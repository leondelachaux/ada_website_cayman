<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Have you ever watched two movies and thought to yourself, "These movies are so different, but they seem to 
be covering the same themes and ideas"? Or perhaps you've noticed that two movies from different countries 
and decades seem to be dealing with similar social issues, sentiments or they could display similar 
characters. What are the typical topics that comes out? Do movies from similar eras or countries also have 
similarities about their content?
<br>
<br>
These are just a few questions that we will be exploring in this project, as we dive into the hidden 
similarities between films from all times and horizons. In order to answer this problem, we will analyze 
the dataset of the movies from the CMU Movie Summary Corpus. We will study several similarity features in 
this dataset of 41783 movies. One feature we will investigate in detail is the topics covered in movie plots. 
Using this similarity metric, we will construct a graph connecting the movies. With this graph, we aim to 
identify clusters of movies and evaluate the relationships and influence between them.
<br>
<br>
When we think about similarity between two movies the first thing that comes to our mind is the content of 
the film, in other words, what topics or what fictional world the plot depicts. By looking beyond 
surface-level differences and diving into the deeper meanings and messages of these films, we can gain 
a greater appreciation for the universal themes and experiences that they depict.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In our initial investigation, we used word clouds to present the findings of the BERTOPIC model's analysis 
of the topic distribution of a collection of film plot summaries organized by decade. The results 
indicated that films encompass a wide range of topics, while also being impacted by the events and 
cultural context of their time period. You can use the arrows above to see the word cloud of each decade.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For instance, the word clouds for the 1930s decade included words related to France, which aligns with the 
golden age of French cinema. Similarly, the 1940s and 1950s decades were marked by the aftermath of World 
War II and the Cold War. While all largely represent the family topic, testifying to the links between the 
characters described in the plots of films. Overall, this study demonstrates the value of the BERTOPIC model 
for our analysis of film similarity. The results of the BERTOPIC analysis provide valuable insight into the 
themes and cultural influences of films, which will be useful in our subsequent analysis of film similarity. 
By analyzing the topic distribution of a collection of film plot summaries, we can observe how films address 
a wide range of topics while still being shaped by the events of their respective time period.
</p>

</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The figure plotted above is a visualization of the results obtained from applying the BERTOPIC model to a 
corpus of film plot summaries. Despite some overlap between the topics, the figure provides valuable and 
accurate information about the relationships between the plots and their corresponding topics. The presence 
of a large number of small topics allows for a detailed analysis of a wide range of films, while merging 
them together would result in the loss of important information about individual, original films. Therefore, 
we decided not to limit the number of topics found by the hbdscan within the BERTOPIC model. Thanks to the 
slider and the interactive nature of the graph, you can explore the different topics represented by the 
three terms with the highest C-TF-IDF scores within the documents belonging to each topic.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To further illustrate the results, we will examine specific topics by identifying the films that are most 
representative of them.

</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
It is worth noting the precision of the BERTOPIC model in differentiating science fiction films based on 
their plot, as seen above. If a film belongs to two topics at the same time (dinosaurs and aliens for example), 
it will have a high probability of belonging to these topics, and this feature will be taken into account 
in the similarity calculation using the cosine function. This approach allows the BERTOPIC model to provide 
a detailed and accurate analysis of science fiction films, enabling a deeper understanding of their 
narrative context and more meaningful comparison.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  Now that we investigated the topics covered in the plots, we can ask ourselves what role plays « sharing 
  the same topics » in the similarity between movies? Also do other features besides topics exist that 
  could allow us to quantify the similarity between movies? In this section we investigate several features 
  that we divide into 4 main categories. All these categories together allow us to define the similarity 
  between movies.
</p>

<h1>Evaluating the similarity between movies</h1>

<iframe src="weights_fig.html" height="500" width="600" frameBorder="0"></iframe>


<p style="text-align: justify">
We have defined the following weights associated to each similarity category in order to calculate the total 
similarity between films:
</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
  <li> 'time' &#128338; 0.1 -This weight represents the importance of the time factor in determining the 
    similarity between films. For example, a film produced in the 50s has more chances to share similarities 
    with closely time-related films than films from the 2000s. Among the other weights, this factor has the 
    least importance. </li>
  <li> 'content' &#128250; 0.6 - This weight represents the importance of the film's content (e.g. genre, plot, 
    characters, headlines) in determining the similarity between films. We chose to weaken the characters' 
    similarity weight, knowing that multiple films share common character names (e.g. Jhon is used .... times!). 
    Increasing the weight on the genre is a good idea because the genre, if well described, is a very good 
    indicator of a film's content. Among the other weights, this factor has the most importance as it describes 
    a film the best.</li>
  <li> 'production' &#128253; 0.15 - This weight represents the importance of the film's production (e.g. director, actors, 
    runtime) in determining the similarity between films. It is not uncommon for actors to frequently appear 
    in films of a similar genre. In fact, the presence of a shared actor in two films could serve as an 
    indicator of potential similarities in content between the two.</li>
  <li> 'geography' &#127757; 0.15 - This weight represents the importance of the film's geography (e.g. language, country) 
    in determining the similarity between films. Films from the same country tend to be more similar, especially 
    if the film's content reflects the country's cultural or societal circumstances or current trends.</li>
</ul> 
<p style="text-align: justify">
We chose these weights based on the importance we want to give to each factor in determining the similarity 
between films. The higher the weight, the more important the factor is in determining the similarity. In particular, we iterated over a list of sequels in order to maximize the score for these 
films, we performed tests using a set of sequels and we found good results that would connect the movies from 
the same sequel.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="similarityMetrics.png">
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
Now that we have established the weight associated with each similarity feature, we need to compute the 
similarity between 0 and 1 for each feature. The methods used are detailed here above. For more details 
about these calculations we invite you to check our code available in open source on 
<a href="https://github.com/epfl-ada/ada-2022-project-talecayu">Github</a>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
We finally get the total similarity between 0 and 1 between every pair of movies and we have obtained our 
similarity relation between every movie of our dataset. Now let’s construct our movie graph!
</p>

<h1>The Movie graph</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="gephi_tuned.png" width="500" height="500">
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
Here is our movie graph constructed with movies as nodes and with similarities as weight on the edges. 
We created a tool able to assess the relations between movies! With this precious tool between our hands, 
it’s time to investigate the complex similarity between movies taking into accounts underlying movies 
characteristics. Let’s evaluate their relationship by finding movie communities in which these relations 
are stronger.
</p>

<h1>Movie communities</h1>


<iframe src="communities/communities_count_barplot.html" height="420" width="600" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
<iframe src="communities/communities_count_pie.html" height="400" width="600" frameBorder="0"></iframe>

<p style="text-align: justify">
We find the communities associated with the movie graph by using the Louvain algorithm. We get 15 communities 
labeled from community 0 until community 14. We notice that we can focus our analysis on the first nine 
communities as they include most of the movies of the dataset. These 9 communities correspond to the color 
code used in the graph. Let’s analyze the movies present in each community to get a sense of what they 
represent, and what links the movies belonging to them.
<br>
<br>
</p>

<p class="mySlides3" style="text-align: justify">
  <iframe src="communities/cluster0_plotly.html" height="800" width="800" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
  <b>Community 0</b>: This community is the largest community in our movie graph which includes 15’300 movies 
  corresponding to 40% of the movies. Because of the size of this community, we expect it to be quite 
  general so that it can correspond to many movies. Let’s check this hypothesis by looking at its 
  characteristics. First, we see that this group is made of mostly American movies which correlates with 
  the fact that this is the most represented country in our dataset. We see that the main genres are 
  respectively in descending importance: Drama, Comedy, Thriller and Romance. These genres are very 
  common movie genres. The topics evolve around the American way of living with topics such as cow-boy 
  related: “Horse, Town, Ranch” or family related: “Wedding, Husband, Wife”. The names of the characters 
  are also common American names: Sam, Jack, Frank, Charlie, … The directors and actors belong to Hollywood, 
  especially old Hollywood movies are present because of casts involving John Wayne, Bette Davis or 
  James Stewart and directed by Alfred Hitchcock, Michael Curtiz. We can see this also by looking at 
  the release year which follows the dataset release year distribution except between the 1930s and the 1950s 
  where it is higher than the dataset distribution. In general, we can define this community by the 
  Hollywood golden age.
</p>

<p class="mySlides3" style="text-align: justify">
  <iframe src="communities/cluster1_plotly.html" height="800" width="800" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
  <b>Community 1</b>: This community is the fourth community in size with 2400 movies. By looking at the movie 
  we notice straight away that these movies are grouped because of their content which revolves around Horror, 
  Thriller and Science fiction which are genres more specific than community 0’s genres for example. 
  This is confirmed by checking the topics covered which are related to Fantastic: 
  “Demon, Ghost” to Horror: “Vampires, Dracula” and to dystopic Science fiction: “Aliens, zombies, 
  Nuclear bomb” or to more futurist science fiction “Comet, Earth, Space”. These movies involving 
  special effects suggest that they correspond to Hollywood or European high budget industry. 
  They set up characters like: Dracula, Batman, or Thor. This is confirmed when checking the countries 
  or the actors: Christopher Lee that played in Lord of the Rings, Peter Cushing known for Sherlock 
  Holmes or Frankenstein. The special effect involved in these movies correlate with the fact these 
  movies are quite recent (80s, 90s, 00s). We could resume this community as Horror and science fiction 
  blockbusters. 
</p>

<p class="mySlides3" style="text-align: justify">
  <iframe src="communities/cluster2_plotly.html" height="800" width="800" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
  <b>Community 2</b>: This community is the third community in size with 4600 movies. This community is contrasted 
  with the previous ones with respect to the country of origin. Here USA is not the main country, as it is 
  in the overall dataset. This community seems more international especially European: France, Italy, 
  Germany, UK, Spain. This is confirmed by the genre “worldwide” ranked second after Drama. The actors 
  such as Gerard Depardieu, Geraldine Chaplin, and directors such as Ingmar Bergman (Swedish), Claude 
  Chabrol (French) show a European production. The topics seems to be classified by countries, which 
  matches the fact that most of the movies are English speaking movies, so non-English can stand out 
  as outliers easily. We could resume this community European cinema. 
</p>

<p class="mySlides3" style="text-align: justify">
  <iframe src="communities/cluster3_plotly.html" height="800" width="800" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
  <b>Community 3</b>: This community is the fourth community in size with 2600 movies. This community is the first 
  one to have a majority of Black and white movies. This indicates that this cluster is separated from the 
  other based on the time context. The decade distribution is not heavy tail towards 2000s and has most 
  films released date before the 1960s. Some uncommon movie genres such as Black-and-White and War film 
  appear. The time context of pre-1960s suggests that the themes covered in the movie could put forward 
  the society context of WW1 and WW2. This is confirmed by the topics that include “German, Sergeant, 
  Aircrfat, Hitler”. This community is not only grouped by the time context but also by the topic of 
  historical drama and fight such as “Musketeers, Pirates” or “Horse, Ranch” related to cow-boys. We could 
  name this group as Action and Adventure past stories
</p>

<p class="mySlides3" style="text-align: justify">
  <iframe src="communities/cluster4_plotly.html" height="800" width="800" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
  <b>Community 4</b>: This community is the 2nd community in size with 6000 movies. This community is very 
  different from the others because it if focused on Indian movies. Indeed, we can see that the main 
  country in “India”, the main languages are Indian languages, the cast is composed of Indian actors 
  and is directed by Indian director. If we look more into the content of these movies, we notice that 
  most of the movies are part of Drama World Cinema or Romance Genre. We can see also a new genre 
  previously unseen “Bollywood”. However, when we look at the topics, we see that many of them are grouped 
  mostly because of Indian words being in the plot. But the first topic of this community is unrelated 
  to Indian culture: “Film, love, village, story” and correlates more the Dramatic characteristic of 
  these movies. Therefore, we see that our topic extraction, which is trained on English words, has 
  trouble finding topics about the plot  unrelated to the Indian names in the plot. This community can 
  be named “Indian Cinema”.
</p>

<p class="mySlides3" style="text-align: justify">
  <iframe src="communities/cluster5_plotly.html" height="800" width="800" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
  <b>Community 5</b>: This community is composed of 1000 movies and is focused on English speaking cinema, 
  in particular American films but it’s different from Community 0 because of the topics covered. 
  We see that the topics are more modern and specific: we have topics about Sport: “Boxing, Baseball, 
  Basketball, Football, Skating” but note that they are distinct topics. We also have topics about Music 
  “Band, music, song, bands” and a topic about Harry Potter “Harry, Voldemort, Dumbledore”. The genres 
  are also diverse: Drama, Comedy, Romance, Sport. So what do these films have in common? They seem 
  to be films related to modern topics, and pop culture which correlates with their release date which 
  is heavily tailed toward the 1990s and 2000s. Their directors are more modern than Community 0 with 
  for example Woody Allen or Garry Marshall. We could define this topic as Modern Hollywood.
</p>

<p class="mySlides3" style="text-align: justify">
  <iframe src="communities/cluster6_plotly.html" height="800" width="800" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
  <b>Community 6</b>: This community is focused on the Japanese movies: we can see that in the language and 
  the countries obviously, as well as the names of actors and directors. More interestingly, we can 
  see that the genre “Anime” and “Animation” is way more popular than in other communities, which is 
  also detected in the topics (with names such as “naruto” and “ash - pokemon”). We also see “Godzilla” 
  as the most popular character in this community.
</p>

<p class="mySlides3" style="text-align: justify">
  <iframe src="communities/cluster7_plotly.html" height="800" width="800" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
  <b>Community 7</b>: This community is focused on cartoons, mostly americans (in English). We also see the 
  genre “Short Film” appear more than in the other communities, which is also reflected in the runtime 
  feature (which isn’t surprising). We can also see that the topics catch popular cartoons such as 
  “Tom and Jerry”, “Buzz Lightyear” and “Shrek”, while the characters catch some others like “Moe”, 
  “Eeyore” and “Mickey Mouse”. In the release date, we see two peaks, one around 1940, and a second 
  one now (which probably will continue growing).
</p>

<p class="mySlides3" style="text-align: justify">
  <iframe src="communities/cluster8_plotly.html" height="800" width="800" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
  <b>Community 8</b>: This film community is more focused on East Asia, while also clearly distinguishing 
  itself from Japanese cinema. This community is a pleasant surprise, as it stands out despite its 
  underrepresentation among other geographic regions. It introduces us to the fact that Hong Kong 
  is a hub of Asian cinema, and that the most commonly spoken language in this community is Mandarin. 
  While naturally acknowledging the most frequently present actor: Jackie Chan.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p style="text-align: justify">
Through our analysis of the movie dataset from the CMU Movie Summary Corpus, we were able to uncover 
the hidden similarities between films from all times and horizons. In fact, by using the BERTOPIC model 
to examine the topic distribution of film plot summaries, we were able to gain valuable insight into the 
themes and cultural influences of films.
<br>
<br>
Considering multiple similarity features, such as plot, characters, and production choices, is essential 
in order to get a more comprehensive understanding of the similarities between films. By constructing a 
graph based on these similarity features, we were able to identify clusters of movies and evaluate the 
relationships and influence between them.
<br>
<br>
The BERTOPIC model and other tools used in this study have great potential for further exploration. 
For example, they could be used to conduct studies of similarity in a temporal context, in order to track 
the course of influences between different geographic regions and cultures.
<br>
<br>
These findings could have significant implications for filmmakers, film critics, and film enthusiasts. 
Filmmakers can draw inspiration from past films while still adding their own unique elements, and film 
critics and enthusiasts can appreciate the universal themes and experiences depicted in films from different 
times and places. Overall, this study underscores the importance of looking beyond surface-level differences 
and exploring the deeper meanings and messages of films in order to gain a greater appreciation for their 
universal themes and experiences.
